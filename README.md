# blurry_loading

Week of projects

---

This project took some more logic to do, because of blurry effect and the opacity used on numbers.

<div>
 <img alt='32% loading blurry' src='https://i.imgur.com/xy57w0C.png' />
</div>

###

<div>
 <img alt='70% loading blurry' src='https://i.imgur.com/vs7bwNq.png' />
</div>

- As you notice above, the loader is disappearing and the image is becoming clearer.

<div>
 <img alt='90% loading blurry' src='https://i.imgur.com/UZX6vnw.png' />
</div>

###

And below the image 100% clear.

<div>
 <img alt='100% no blurry' src='https://i.imgur.com/1HcxgRU.png' />
